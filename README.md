# PythonMachineLearning
Code created while reading through Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka
and Vahid Mirjalili

As of writing, all code is my own, not transcribed from the book, though I am
basing the code off the algorithms which are presented in mathematical form. I
am also trying out these exercises in multiple languages.
